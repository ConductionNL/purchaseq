# Context Brief: Catalog & Purchase Management — Shillinq — Other T3

**App:** Shillinq — Complete open-source business administration suite for freelancers, sole proprietors, SMBs, and corporations. Combines bookkeeping, invoicing, procurement, and contract management into one self-hosted solution on Nextcloud.Named after the shilling — one of the oldest and most widely used coins in European history, from the Roman solidus to the British shilling to the East African shilling still in use today.Shillinq covers:- Bookkeeping & general ledger (double-entry accounting)- Accounts payable & receivable- Sales invoicing & e-invoicing (UBL/Peppol)- Purchase orders & procurement workflows- Supplier management & approval chains- Contract lifecycle management (creation, renewal, obligations)- Bank reconciliation & payment matching- VAT/tax reporting & compliance- Financial statements (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow)- Budget planning & forecasting- Multi-currency support- Dutch government compliance (BBV, IV3, SiSa, DigiInkoop)
**Spec:** catalog-purchase-management-other-t3
**Platform:** Nextcloud + OpenRegister

## Placement & Information Architecture

**Placement type:** `DETAIL_TAB` — Tab on the detail view of an existing object. NOT a standalone page — appears inside the parent record's detail surface (e.g. an extra tab on the existing detail header).

**Lives at:** Inkopen > Bestelling > Goedkeuring

**Rationale:** approval flow embedded  
_Source: /tmp/ia-small5.md_

> **Implementation note for builders:** Respect the placement above. Do not promote this spec to a top-level menu item, sub-page, or new route unless the placement type explicitly says so. If the placement is `DETAIL_TAB`, `WIDGET`, `ACTION`, `SETTING`, or `INFRA`, the feature must NOT introduce a new entry in the app sidebar. When in doubt, ask before creating a new top-level surface.

## Company-Wide Architecture Rules (13 ADRs)

These rules are MANDATORY for all Conduction apps.

### ADR-001-data-layer
- ALL domain data → OpenRegister objects. NO custom Entity/Mapper for domain data.
- App config → `IAppConfig`. NOT OpenRegister.
- Schemas: PascalCase, schema.org vocabulary where equivalent exists, explicit types.
- Cross-entity references: OpenRegister relations (register+schema+objectId). NO foreign keys.
- Register templates: `lib/Settings/{app}_register.json` (OpenAPI 3.0 + x-openregister).
- Seed data: 3-5 realistic objects per schema using `@self` envelope (`register`, `schema`, `slug`).
  Use general org data (municipality/consultancy), NOT context-specific. Include in design.md.
- Breaking schema changes → new migration in repair step. NEVER modify existing migrations.

### OpenRegister + @conduction/nextcloud-vue — DO NOT REBUILD

The platform provides 258+ backend methods and 69+ frontend components. Apps ONLY build
custom logic for domain-specific business rules. Everything below is provided for FREE.

**CRUD & Data Management** (use ObjectService + CnIndexPage + CnDetailPage):
- Single & bulk create, read, update, delete — `ObjectService.saveObject()`, `deleteObject()`

### What apps SHOULD build (custom business logic only):
- External API integrations (SAP, Peppol, TenderNed, etc.)
- PDF/document generation with business-specific templates
- Workflow triggers and business rules specific to the domain
- Notification dispatch with app-specific event types
- Custom settings pages with app-specific configuration
- Background jobs for domain-specific processing

### ADR-002-api
- URL pattern: `/index.php/apps/{app}/api/{resource}` — lowercase plural, hyphens.
- Methods: GET=read, POST=create, PUT=update, DELETE=remove. No custom methods.
- Pagination: support `_page` + `_limit`. Response includes `total`, `page`, `pages`.
- Errors: appropriate HTTP status + `message` field. NO stack traces in responses.
- Auth: Nextcloud built-in only. NO custom login/session/token flows.
- Public endpoints: annotate `#[PublicPage]` + `#[NoCSRFRequired]`. Register CORS OPTIONS route.

### ADR-003-backend
- **Controller → Service → Mapper** (strict 3-layer). Controllers NEVER call mappers directly.
- Controllers: thin (<10 lines/method). Routing + validation + response only.
- Services: ALL business logic. Stateless — no instance state between requests.
- Mappers: DB CRUD only. No business logic.
- DI: constructor injection with `private readonly`. NO `\OC::$server` or static locators.
- Entity setters: POSITIONAL args only. `$e->setName('val')` — NEVER `$e->setName(name: 'val')`.
  (`__call` passes `['name' => val]` but `setter()` uses `$args[0]`.)
- Routes: `appinfo/routes.php`. Specific routes BEFORE wildcard `{slug}` routes.
- Config: `IAppConfig` with sensitive flag for secrets. NEVER read DB directly.
- Lifecycle: schema init via repair steps (`IRepairStep`), background via job queue, events via dispatcher.
- **Spec traceability**: every class and public method MUST have `@spec` PHPDoc tag(s) linking to
  the OpenSpec change that caused it: `@spec openspec/changes/{name}/tasks.md#task-N`.
  Multiple `@spec` tags allowed (code touched by multiple changes). File-level `@spec` in header docblock.
  This enables: code → docblock → spec traceability alongside code → git blame → commit → issue → spec.

### ADR-004-frontend
- **Vue 2 + Pinia + @nextcloud/vue + @conduction/nextcloud-vue**. NO Vuex. Options API only.
- State: Pinia stores in `src/store/modules/`. Use `createObjectStore` for OpenRegister CRUD.
- `fetch()` for API calls — NOT axios. Loading state with `try/finally`.
- Translations: ALL user-visible strings via `t(appName, 'text')`. NO hardcoded strings.
- CSS: ONLY Nextcloud CSS variables. NO hardcoded colors. NEVER reference `--nldesign-*`.
- Router: history mode, base `/index.php/apps/{app}/`, catch-all `*` redirects to `/`.
- OpenRegister dependency: settings returns `openRegisters` (bool) + `isAdmin`.
  Show empty state if OR missing. NEVER use `OC.isAdmin` — get from backend.

### @conduction/nextcloud-vue — ALWAYS check before building custom

  `selectionPlugin` | `searchPlugin` | `registerMappingPlugin`

**Utilities:**
  `columnsFromSchema()` | `filtersFromSchema()` | `fieldsFromSchema()` |
  `formatValue()` | `buildHeaders()` | `buildQueryString()`

### Page Construction Patterns (follow these recipes)

**App.vue:** `NcContent` → 3 states: loading (`NcLoadingIcon`), no-OpenRegister (`NcEmptyContent`),
  ready (`MainMenu` + `NcAppContent` + `router-view` + optional `CnIndexSidebar`).
  Inject `sidebarState` for child components. `created()` calls `initializeStores()`.

**MainMenu:** `NcAppNavigation` with `NcAppNavigationItem` per route (icon + name + `:to`).
  Footer: settings link via `NcAppNavigationSettings`.

**Dashboard:** `CnDashboardPage` with `CnStatsBlock` KPIs (4 cards: open/overdue/value/completed),
  status distribution chart, "My Work" list (grouped: overdue → due this week → rest).
  Fetch all collections in parallel via `Promise.all`. Widget templates via `#widget-{id}` slots.

**Index page:** `CnIndexPage` with `useListView(entityType, { sidebarState, objectStore })`.
  Inject sidebarState. Row click → `$router.push({ name: 'EntityDetail', params: { id } })`.
  Add button → new entity detail with id='new'.

**Detail page:** Two modes — edit (form component) / view (`CnDetailPage` + `CnDetailCard` sections).
  Header actions: Edit + Delete buttons. Related entities in table inside `CnDetailCard`.
  Props: `entityId` from route. `isNew = entityId === 'new'`. Sidebar via `CnObjectSidebar`.

**Settings:** `CnVersionInfoCard` (FIRST, always) → `CnRegisterMapping` → `CnSettingsSection` per feature.
  Load settings from `GET /api/settings`. Save via `POST /api/settings`.
  Re-import button calls `POST /api/settings/load`.

**Router:** Flat routes (no nesting), all named, props via arrow function for params.
  Routes: `/` (Dashboard), `/{entities}` (list), `/{entities}/:id` (detail), `/settings`.

**Store init:** `initializeStores()` in `store/store.js` — fetches settings, then calls
  `objectStore.registerObjectType(name, schemaSlug, registerSlug)` for each entity.
  Object store uses `createObjectStore` with plugins (files, auditTrails, relations).
  Settings store: Pinia `defineStore` with `fetchSettings()` and `saveSettings()`.

### ADR-005-security
- Auth: Nextcloud built-in ONLY. NO custom login, sessions, tokens, password storage.
- Admin check: `IGroupManager::isAdmin()` on BACKEND. Frontend-only checks = vulnerability.
- Multi-tenant isolation: enforce at API/service level, not UI only.
- NO PII in logs, error responses, or debug output.
- File uploads: validate type + size before storage.
- API responses: NO stack traces, SQL, or internal paths.

### ADR-006-metrics
- Every app: `GET /api/metrics` (Prometheus text, admin auth) + `GET /api/health` (JSON, public).
- Metric names: `{app}_` prefix. MUST include `{app}_health_status` and `{app}_info`.
- Health check MUST verify OpenRegister connectivity (for apps that depend on it).

### ADR-007-i18n
- Minimum: Dutch (nl) + English (en) translations.
- PHP: `$this->l->t('key')`. JS: `t(appName, 'key')`.
- API field names: English. Date/number formatting: respect user locale.
- Each app with OpenRegister: define `register-i18n` spec listing translatable fields.

### ADR-008-testing
- Every new PHP service/controller → PHPUnit tests in `tests/Unit/` (≥3 methods).
- Every new Vue component → test file (if test framework exists).
- Every new API endpoint → Newman/Postman collection in `tests/integration/`.
- Every spec scenario → browser test (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN verified via Playwright).
- All tests MUST pass in `composer check:strict`.

### ADR-009-docs
- Every user-facing feature → docs in `docs/` with screenshots from running app.
- English primary, Dutch recommended. Update docs when behavior changes.

### ADR-010-nl-design
- ALL UI: CSS custom properties from NL Design System tokens. NO hardcoded colors, fonts, spacing.
- Theme switching: support `nldesign` app's token sets (Rijkshuisstijl, Utrecht, municipality-specific).
- Components: `@nextcloud/vue` primary. Custom components styled via NL Design tokens only.
- Scoped styles: ALL `<style>` blocks MUST use `scoped` attribute.
- WCAG AA mandatory: keyboard-navigable, labelled forms, color not sole conveyor, alt text on images.
- Responsive: work from 320px to 1920px. Critical features accessible at 768px.
- Specs: reference token names ("primary action color") NOT hex values. Include a11y verification in ACs.
- Exception: PDF generation (docudesk) may use fixed dimensions. Admin screens MAY simplify but MUST meet WCAG AA.

### ADR-011-schema-standards
- schema.org types/properties as primary vocabulary (`schema:Person`, `schema:Organization`, `schema:Event`).
- Contact schemas: align with vCard properties (`fn`, `email`, `tel`, `adr`).
- Dutch government fields: mapping layer translating between international standards and Dutch APIs (VNG, ZGW).
- NO custom property names when schema.org equivalent exists.
- Relations: OpenRegister relation mechanism (register + schema + objectId). NO foreign keys or embedded objects.
- Versioning: removing/renaming properties = BREAKING → migration via repair step. Adding optional = non-breaking.
- Specs MUST define data models using schema.org vocabulary; design docs MUST include schema definitions with types, required flags, relations.
- Exception: app-specific workflow states (pipeline stages, process statuses) MAY use custom vocabularies.

### ADR-012-deduplication
- Before proposing new capability: search OpenRegister specs + services for overlap. Reference + justify if similar exists.
- Design docs MUST include "Reuse Analysis" listing which OpenRegister services are leveraged.
- If logic could benefit other apps → propose adding to OpenRegister core, not app-specific.
- Tasks MUST include "Deduplication Check" verifying no overlap with:
  ObjectService, RegisterService, SchemaService, ConfigurationService, shared specs, @conduction/nextcloud-vue.
- Document findings even if "no overlap found".
- Exception: OpenRegister checks internal duplication only. nldesign checks token sets. nextcloud-vue checks own components.

### ADR-013-container-pool
# ADR-013: Unified Container Pool

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-12

## Context

Specter (intelligence/research) and Hydra (build/review/merge) both run LLM workloads in Docker containers. Today they operate independently: Hydra spins up builder/reviewer/security containers on demand, Specter has a separate `run_llm_containers.sh` wrapper. Both compete for the same Claude Max rate limits.

We want to unify these into a **single priority-scheduled container pool** so that:
- Critical work (bugfixes, reviews) preempts lower-priority work (discovery, research)
- A fixed number of containers (e.g. 10) run continuously, pulling from a shared queue
- Token rotation and rate limit recovery happen at the pool level, not per-script
- Adding a new workload type (audit, spec generation, test) is just a new queue entry

## Decision

### Container types (priority order)

| Priority | Type | Source | Container image | Model |
|----------|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | **bugfix** | Hydra: fix iteration after review failure | `hydra-builder` | opus |
| 2 | **code-review** | Hydra: PR code review | `hydra-reviewer` | sonnet |
| 3 | **security-review** | Hydra: PR security review | `hydra-security` | sonnet |
| 4 | **build** | Hydra: initial spec build | `hydra-builder` | opus |
| 5 | **audit** | Hydra: codebase audit | `hydra-builder` | sonnet |
| 6 | **spec-generation** | Specter: push_spec_pipeline | `specter-llm-worker` | sonnet |
| 7 | **schema-synthesis** | Specter: generate/dedup schemas | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku |
| 8 | **classification** | Specter: classify/redistribute features | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku |
| 9 | **translation** | Specter: translate requirements | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku |
| 10 | **discovery** | Specter: research, feature extraction | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku |

### Queue table (future)

```sql
CREATE TABLE container_queue (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,        -- bugfix, code-review, build, classify, etc.
    priority INTEGER NOT NULL,         -- 1=highest
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,            -- script args, spec slug, issue URL, etc.
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, running, completed, failed
    container_id VARCHAR(100),         -- docker container name when running
    token_account VARCHAR(50),         -- which OAuth account is assigned
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    exit_code INTEGER,
    error_message TEXT
);
```

### Phased rollout

**Phase 1 (now):** All LLM calls containerized. Specter scripts run via `run_llm_containers.sh`. Hydra containers use `run_container_with_fallback`. Both read from `credentials.json`. No shared queue yet — each system schedules its own containers.

**Phase 2:** Shared queue table. A single scheduler script replaces both `cron-hydra.sh` dispatch and `run_llm_containers.sh`. Pool size configurable. Priority enforcement by not starting low-prio work when high-prio is queued.

**Phase 3:** Preemption. Running low-priority containers can be stopped (gracefully, with checkpoint) when high-priority work arrives and all slots are occupied. Container images support checkpoint/resume via DB state.

### Current state (Phase 1)

Both systems already containerize LLM calls:
- **Hydra:** `builder`, `reviewer`, `security` images in `hydra/images/`
- **Specter:** `specter-llm-worker` image via `Dockerfile.llm-worker`
- **Shared credentials:** `hydra/secrets/credentials.json` with priority-ordered OAuth tokens
- **Token fallback:** Hydra via `credentials.sh`, Specter via `credentials.py`

## Consequences

- All LLM calls go through containers — no direct `claude -p` from host scripts
- Token management is centralized in `credentials.json`
- Future pool scheduler can enforce rate limits across both systems
- Container images are the unit of deployment — version, test, rollback independently
